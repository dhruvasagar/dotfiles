# My dotfiles

This repository contains all my dotfiles as well as other commonly used
configuration files.

It also provides a good platform agnostic setup process that not only
sets up these configuration files needed by various developer tools that I use
but also install all basic tools necessary to create my development
environment on a new machine

## Setup

Simply run `./setup` in this directory to setup all required tools as well
as set all configuration files appropriately.
