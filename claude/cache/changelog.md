# Changelog

## 2.1.162

- `claude agents --json` now includes `waitingFor` showing what a waiting session is blocked on (e.g. permission prompt)
- `--tools`: explicitly listing Grep/Glob now provides the dedicated search tools on native builds with embedded search (previously these names were silently ignored)
- `/effort` now confirms when your chosen level will persist as the default for new sessions
- Clicking a slash command in the autocomplete menu now fills it into your prompt instead of running it immediately; press Enter to run
- Remote Control now shows as a persistent footer pill (with a link to the session) instead of a startup message
- Renamed Windsurf to Devin Desktop in the `/ide` menu, `/terminal-setup`, and `/scroll-speed`, following the editor's rebrand
- Fixed a silent startup hang when the config directory is read-only or unwritable — Claude Code now starts with in-memory config and surfaces startup errors instead of showing a blank screen
- Fixed WebFetch permission rules not being applied to built-in preapproved domains; explicit `WebFetch(domain:...)` deny/ask/allow rules now take precedence over the preapproved-host auto-allow
- Fixed Windows permission rules never matching when spelled with backslashes (`~\`, `\\server\share`) or case-variant paths, and Read deny rules not hiding files from Glob/Grep results
- Fixed an interrupt (Esc) sent at the very start of a turn being silently dropped in stream-json/SDK sessions, leaving the turn running with no "Interrupted" feedback
- Fixed API 400 `no low surrogate in string` errors for classifier side-queries and MCP server descriptions containing emoji near a truncation boundary
- Fixed MCP per-server `timeout` config values below 1000 ms being floored to a 1-second watchdog that aborted every tool call; sub-1000 ms values are now ignored (falling back to `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` or default), and `claude mcp get` annotates them accordingly
- Fixed the LSP tool's `workspaceSymbol` operation returning no results; it now accepts a `query` parameter and passes it to the language server
- Fixed `claude agents` cutting live status text (tool args, replies, prompts, exec output) at 60–120 columns on wide terminals; the status detail now uses the full terminal width
- Fixed `claude agents` truncating long session names at 40 columns; the name column now grows with terminal width
- Fixed `claude agents` attach occasionally bouncing straight back to the session list on the first try after a background-service restart
- Fixed `claude agents` Ctrl+V image paste doing nothing in the dispatch input and the session reply box; pasting with no image now shows a hint
- Fixed backgrounding a session with ← silently losing the conversation when the background service cannot start; the session stays in the list as a failed row you can wake with Enter
- Fixed replies from the agents view that fail to send being lost; they are now queued for delivery on the next session start
- Fixed cross-session messaging (`SendMessage`) silently breaking when `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` or `$TMPDIR` points at a deep directory
- Fixed opening a running background session from `claude agents` stalling for 5 seconds before attaching
- Quieter startup: notices group by severity, and session info and announcements share a single line per launch
- Startup warnings rewritten to be shorter and clearer, each with a concrete fix
- Launch-prompt warnings (deep link/pre-filled prompt) now stay pinned below the input until you act instead of scrolling away
- Failed turns now show a compact warning line instead of a multi-line red error block
- Improved background service startup and `claude update` verification to wait out endpoint-security scanning of new binaries instead of failing after 5 seconds
- Background dispatch spawn failures now report the error class name when no errno is available
- Removed the "Claude in Chrome enabled" and "marketplace installed" startup messages; model auto-updates and the team-onboarding tip now show as quiet notices under the logo

## 2.1.161

- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` values are now included as labels on metric datapoints, so you can slice usage metrics by custom dimensions like team or repo
- `claude agents` rows now show `done/total` before the detail when work is fanned out; peek shows the longest-running item
- `/mcp` now collapses claude.ai connectors you've never signed in to behind a "Show unused connectors" row
- Parallel tool calls: a failed Bash command no longer cancels other calls in the same batch — each tool returns its own result independently
- Fullscreen mode: clipboard now uses `wl-copy`/`xclip`/`xsel` on Linux when available, copies to both the clipboard and PRIMARY selection for middle-click paste, and the "hold {key} for native selection" hint now shows the correct key per terminal
- Fixed the `/effort` dialog, workflow animations, and prompt keyword shimmer not honoring the "Reduce motion" setting
- Fixed `forceLoginOrgUUID`/`forceLoginMethod` managed-settings policies blocking third-party provider sessions (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, Mantle) alongside the org pin (regression in 2.1.146)
- Fixed background subagent output corrupting `claude -p` stdout when using `--output-format text` or `json`
- Fixed `/usage-credits` starting a re-login for Team and Enterprise admins instead of pointing to the organization's usage settings page
- Fixed `/autofix-pr` reporting "cannot run on the default branch" when the session is inside a git worktree or another repository
- Fixed `--resume` picker not showing sessions from the current directory when it isn't a git worktree (e.g., jj workspaces)
- Fixed Windows hooks that invoke bash explicitly (e.g., `/usr/bin/bash script.sh`) failing with "command not found" or "cannot execute binary file"
- Fixed OpenTelemetry log events (`user_prompt`, `api_request`, `tool_result`, `tool_decision`) being silently dropped when emitted before telemetry initialization completed
- Fixed `claude mcp` list/get/add printing secrets to the terminal: `${VAR}` references are no longer expanded, and credential headers and URL secrets are redacted
- Fixed Workflow agents spawned with `isolation: "worktree"` in background sessions being blocked from editing files inside their own worktree
- Fixed background sessions dispatched from `claude agents` booting on a stale model from the daemon's environment instead of the model in `settings.json`
- Fixed a potential crash when rendering Write tool results after resuming a session
- Fixed completed subagents getting stuck showing as running when an error occurs while finalizing their result
- Fixed `EADDRINUSE` errors from tools that bind Unix sockets under `$TMPDIR` when `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` is set to a deep path
- Improved terminal rendering performance by stabilizing the layout engine's JIT compilation profile
- Improved rendering performance for large file writes
- [VSCode] Added a tip suggesting disabling terminal GPU acceleration (or running `/terminal-setup`) to fix garbled glyphs

## 2.1.160

- Added a prompt before writing to shell startup files (`.zshenv`, `.zlogin`, `.bash_login`) and `~/.config/git/`, which could otherwise lead to unintended command execution
- `acceptEdits` mode now prompts before writing build-tool config files that grant code execution (`.npmrc`, `.yarnrc*`, `bunfig.toml`, `.bazelrc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.devcontainer/`, etc.)
- Edit no longer requires a separate Read after viewing a file with `grep`: single-file `grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep` commands now satisfy the read-before-edit check
- Fixed copy-on-select not writing to the Windows clipboard on WSL — now uses PowerShell interop instead of OSC 52, which terminals like MobaXterm don't support
- Fixed restoring a completed session from `claude agents` dropping chat history and re-running the original prompt
- Fixed background sessions re-attached after overnight retire losing their conversation and re-running the original prompt
- Fixed `claude --bg` occasionally failing with "socket missing" when the background daemon was cold-starting on a loaded machine
- Fixed an issue on Windows where the directory a background session was started in could not be deleted after `claude rm` until the background daemon exited
- Fixed background agents that resumed work being shown under Completed in the agents list
- Fixed `claude agents` freezing for several seconds when returning to the session list due to the auto-updater re-checking on every exit
- Fixed Esc, arrow keys, and typing becoming unresponsive on Windows when attached to a background session or in the agent view while the host is under heavy CPU load
- Fixed background agents emitting terminal sync-output markers to terminals that don't support them (Apple Terminal, tmux), causing render artifacts when entering a running agent
- Fixed mouse wheel scrolling prompt history instead of the transcript right after opening a session from the agents list
- Fixed CJK IME composition appearing at the bottom-left of the screen instead of at the input caret in the `claude agents` view
- Fixed valid `file:///C:/...` links being rewritten to a broken path on Windows terminals with hyperlink support
- Fixed voice mode failing to connect when the project directory or branch name contains non-ASCII or special characters
- Fixed the auto mode unavailability message on third-party providers (Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry) to point to the `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE` opt-in instead of incorrectly blaming the model
- Fixed `/effort ultracode` incorrectly blaming the dynamic workflows setting when the model cannot run xhigh; ultracode is no longer offered on models that do not support it
- Fixed model-not-found errors suggesting `--model` when running via the SDK or other hosts where the CLI flag doesn't apply
- Fixed Claude's past replies disappearing from scrollback when resuming a brief mode session with brief mode turned off
- Fixed vim mode `p` pasting on the line below instead of at the cursor when the register was yanked with `v$`
- Improved performance of opening recently-inactive background agent sessions in `claude agents`
- Improved auto mode classifier latency by reducing reasoning on routine actions, lowering the chance of "could not evaluate this action" blocks
- Improved background-session teardown (`claude rm`/`stop`, idle reap) to send SIGTERM to running shell subprocesses before SIGKILL, so cleanup handlers run
- Removed `CLAUDE_CODE_OPUS_4_6_FAST_MODE_OVERRIDE`; the environment variable is now a no-op
- Removed the JetBrains plugin install suggestion from startup
- Renamed the dynamic-workflow trigger keyword from `workflow` to `ultracode`. The word "workflow" no longer triggers a run; asking for one in your own words still works. The trigger keyword is highlighted in violet in the prompt input

## 2.1.159

- Internal infrastructure improvements (no user-facing changes)

## 2.1.158

- `claude agents`: the `agent` field in `settings.json` is now honored for dispatched sessions, with `--agent <name>` to override it
- `EnterWorktree` can now switch between Claude-managed worktrees mid-session
- `tool_decision` telemetry events now include `tool_parameters` (bash commands, MCP/skill names) when `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1`
- Worktrees managed by Claude are now left unlocked when the agent finishes, so `git worktree remove`/`prune` can clean them up

- Fixed the `--resume` session picker leaving its contents on the terminal after exiting in fullscreen mode
- Fixed `--worktree` and `--worktree --tmux` returning to the canonical repo root instead of the current linked worktree
- Fixed the `/model` picker showing an incorrect "Newer version available" hint when the selected model is already the newest in its family; the pinned-model row now shows the model's description instead of its raw ID
- Fixed literal markdown markers (backticks, asterisks) appearing in the in-progress message text in fullscreen mode
- Fixed the terminal freezing after approving the managed-settings security dialog at startup
- Fixed a rare duplicate line appearing in scrollback after the terminal UI redraws

- Removed the "bash commands will be sandboxed" startup banner — sandbox status still shows in `/status` and when a command is blocked
- Removed the "/ide for …" startup hint toast
- [IDE] Fixed clicking Stop while a background subagent is running not actually stopping it
- [VSCode] Fixed the fast mode indicator not appearing on Opus 4.8

- Added a "Workflow keyword trigger" setting in /config to stop the word "workflow" in a prompt from triggering a dynamic workflow

## 2.1.156

- Fixed an issue when using Opus 4.8 where thinking blocks were modified, leading to API errors.

## 2.1.154

- Opus 4.8 is here! Now defaults to high effort · /effort xhigh for your hardest tasks
- Introducing dynamic workflows: ask Claude to create a workflow and it orchestrates work across tens to hundreds of agents in the background, so you can take on larger, more complex tasks. Run `/workflows` to view your runs
- Fast mode on Opus 4.8 is now available at a fraction of its previous cost: 2x the standard rate for 2.5x the speed
- The lean system prompt is now the default for all models except Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus 4.7 and earlier
- Claude now reserves the multiple-choice question prompt for decisions it genuinely cannot make itself, instead of asking when it already has enough context to proceed
- `/simplify` now runs a cleanup-only review (reuse, simplification, efficiency, altitude) and applies the fixes, instead of running the full `/code-review --fix` bug-hunting review
- Renamed the `/effort` slider labels from "Speed"/"Intelligence" to "Faster"/"Smarter" for clarity
- `claude agents`: type `! <command>` to run a shell command as a background session you can attach to and detach from. Also available as `claude --bg --exec '<command>'`
- `claude agents`: `/logout` now signs you out instead of being sent to a background session
- `←←` to open the agents view now works on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, and with telemetry disabled
- Claude in Chrome: pick which connected browser to use via `/chrome` → "Select browser…", or in-chat when a browser action runs with multiple connected
- Plugins can now declare `defaultEnabled: false` in `plugin.json` or a marketplace entry; enable them with `/plugin` or `claude plugin enable`. Dependencies of enabled plugins are still enabled automatically
- The `/plugin` Discover tab now pins plugins whose relevance signals match the current directory with a "suggested for this directory" annotation
- Streaming tool execution is now always enabled, including when telemetry is disabled or on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry (previously behind a feature flag)
- Stdio MCP server subprocesses now receive `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and `CLAUDECODE=1` in their environment
- `claude mcp list`/`get` now show unapproved `.mcp.json` servers as `⏸ Pending approval` instead of auto-approving and connecting when output is piped
- `/remote-control` autocomplete now shows "Disconnect Remote Control" when Remote Control is already active
- Added Claude Opus 4.8 support and 4.7 → 4.8 migration guidance to the `/claude-api` skill
- Deprecated `CLAUDE_CODE_OPUS_4_6_FAST_MODE_OVERRIDE` (will be removed on 06/01). To use fast mode on Opus 4.6, switch with `/model claude-opus-4-6[1m]` and then `/fast on`
- Improved the auto-mode classifier's detection of data exfiltration, particularly bulk transfers of repository contents
- Fixed `rm -rf $HOME` not being blocked as a dangerous path when `HOME` has a trailing slash
- Fixed `$TMPDIR` resolving to different directories in sandboxed vs unsandboxed Bash commands within the same session
- Fixed unreadable highlighted-row text in `claude agents` when the Claude Code theme doesn't match the terminal background
- Fixed background-agent completion notifications triggering premature "out of context" behavior on some 1M-context models
- Fixed background-session classifier losing the user's goal when a scheduled `/command` fires
- Fixed pinned background sessions respawning every minute after a Claude Code update, causing repeated agent-start notifications and process churn at idle
- Fixed background sessions stuck at "blocked", "running", or "working" not retiring after the idle grace period
- Fixed subagents in background sessions bypassing the worktree-isolation guard and writing to the shared checkout
- Fixed orphaned `claude --bg-pty-host` processes spinning at 100% CPU after the daemon exits on macOS
- Fixed number key shortcuts not working for options shown below the divider in option dialogs
- Fixed `worktree.baseRef: "head"` resolving to the main checkout's HEAD instead of the current worktree's HEAD when spawning subagents or calling `EnterWorktree` from inside a linked worktree
- Fixed a stray leading space on wrapped lines when the previous line ended exactly at the terminal width
- Fixed intermittent terminal rendering corruption in VS Code by capping the number of distinct colors the thinking spinner produces
- Fixed plan file names including `[Image #N]` / `[Pasted text #N]` placeholders when a plan-mode prompt starts with pasted images or text
- Fixed a phantom expand/click affordance on colored tool output: short ANSI-colored lines that fit on screen no longer show a "ctrl+o to expand" hint
- Fixed a single invalid `allowedMcpServers`/`deniedMcpServers` entry in managed settings discarding all managed-settings policy; the bad entry is now dropped with a `claude doctor` warning
- Fixed API 400 errors on models that don't support the effort parameter when `CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT` is set
- Windows: Fixed update failures caused by `claude.exe` being in use showing a generic error instead of telling you to close other sessions and retry
- Removed the stale "& for background" hint from the shortcuts help panel
- [VSCode] Auto mode no longer requires the bypass-permissions setting to appear in the mode picker, and a dismissable notice on the new-session screen explains auto mode the first time it's active
- Fixed the task panel below the prompt showing a stray unselectable "main" row when only a workflow is running
- Fixed /mcp tools list and tool detail rendering when MCP servers have long or multi-line tool names or long descriptions
- Fixed the /model picker not showing fast mode pricing on the Default option for API (pay-as-you-go) users when fast mode is on
- Fixed auto mode incorrectly blocking actions with "could not evaluate this action" when the safety classifier ran out of output tokens while reasoning

## 2.1.153

- Added `skipLfs` option to `github`/`git` plugin marketplace sources to skip Git LFS downloads during clone and update
- Claude Code now shows a one-time notice when your npm global install can't auto-update; `/doctor` lists the fixes

- Fixed `claude --help` rendering unwrapped output on terminals narrower than 92 columns
- Fixed MCP tool progress notifications not rendering in the collapsed tool view

- `/bg` while Claude is responding now continues the response in the background session instead of dropping it
- Fixed `/btw` keyboard shortcuts becoming unresponsive in background sessions while a task is running
- Fixed background sessions writing temp files to `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR` triggering a "sensitive file" permission prompt
- Fixed recovering a background agent whose working directory was deleted showing a truncated stack trace instead of a clear error message

- Fixed Windows update rollback: if a Windows update fails, Claude Code now restores the original executable by copy and tells you how to recover
- [VSCode] Fixed Claude Code processes not shutting down cleanly when VS Code closed on Windows, causing false "unclean exit" reports and orphaned MCP servers
- `/model` now saves your selection as the default for new sessions (matching the IDE). Press `s` in the picker to switch models for the current session only.
- If you customized the `modelPicker:setAsDefault` keybinding, rename it to `modelPicker:thisSessionOnly` in keybindings.json (the `d` action was replaced by `s`)

## 2.1.152

- `/code-review --fix` now applies review findings to your working tree after the review, surfacing reuse, simplification, and efficiency suggestions; `/simplify` now invokes `/code-review --fix`
- Skills and slash commands can now set `disallowed-tools` in frontmatter to remove tools from the model while the skill is active
- Added `/reload-skills` command to re-scan skill directories without restarting the session
- `SessionStart` hooks can now return `reloadSkills: true` to re-scan skill directories, making skills installed by the hook available in the same session
- `SessionStart` hooks can now set the session title via `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle` on startup and resume
- Added a `MessageDisplay` hook event that lets hooks transform or hide assistant message text as it is displayed
- Added `pluginSuggestionMarketplaces` managed setting: admins can allowlist org marketplaces whose plugins may be suggested via context-aware tips
- `claude plugin marketplace remove` now accepts `--scope user|project|local` for symmetry with `marketplace add`, `install`, and `uninstall`
- Claude Code now switches to your configured `--fallback-model` for the rest of the session when the primary model is not found, instead of failing every request
- Auto mode no longer requires opt-in consent
- Vim mode: `/` in NORMAL mode now opens reverse history search (like Ctrl+R), matching bash/zsh vi-mode
- The `/usage` breakdown now includes large session files; files are scanned with a streaming read so memory usage stays flat
- Thinking summaries in the collapsed group now stay readable for at least 3 seconds, render as markdown, and cap at 10 lines (`Ctrl+O` shows the full thinking)
- In fullscreen mode, the "Thinking for Ns" indicator now counts up live while the model is thinking, and keeps its value if you interrupt mid-thought
- Simplified the Workflow tool's inline progress display — live agent counts now show only in the persistent workflow status row below the prompt
- The post-response timer now shows "Waiting for N background agents/workflows to finish" when backgrounded agents or workflows are still running, and reports the cumulative time once their results are processed
- Added the session entrypoint as an OpenTelemetry metric attribute (`app.entrypoint`, opt-in via `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ENTRYPOINT=true`)
- Fixed terminal styling degrading in very long sessions by recycling the renderer's style pool
- Fixed the sandbox-enabled warning not appearing in condensed startup mode — it now shows in every layout
- Fixed the loading spinner showing "still thinking"/"almost done thinking" while a tool is running, and reset the thinking status to "thinking" after each tool
- Fixed focus mode showing a spurious "N messages hidden" count on turns with no hidden activity
- Fixed clicking a link inside an expanded tool result collapsing the section instead of opening the link
- Fixed markdown table cell borders inheriting the color of inline code, wrapped continuation lines losing their style, and empty header cells showing a label in the narrow-terminal stacked layout

- Fixed the effort-change confirmation dialog appearing when the conversation has no messages or when switching between effort levels that resolve to the same underlying value
- Fixed the Agent tool description referencing an agent list that is never delivered when running with `--bare` or with attachments disabled
- Fixed a background worker crash in `claude agents` when accepting a stale permission prompt after a subagent was cancelled
- Fixed `cache_creation_input_tokens` reporting as 0 in transcript and result usage when the API reports cache writes only via the nested `cache_creation` breakdown
- Fixed the PushNotification tool incorrectly reporting "Mobile push not sent (Remote Control inactive)" in SDK-hosted sessions when Remote Control is enabled
- Fixed sessions getting stuck after a model or login switch left stale thinking-block signatures in history; now stripped proactively with a retry safety-net

## 2.1.150

- Internal infrastructure improvements (no user-facing changes)

## 2.1.149

- `/usage` now shows a per-category breakdown of what's driving your limits usage — skills, subagents, plugins, and per-MCP-server cost
- `/diff` detail view can now be scrolled with the keyboard (arrows, `j`/`k`, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `Space`, `Home`/`End`)
- Markdown output now renders GFM task list checkboxes (`- [ ] todo` / `- [x] done`) instead of plain bullets
- Enterprise: added the `allowAllClaudeAiMcps` managed setting to load claude.ai cloud MCP connectors alongside `managed-mcp.json`
- Fixed a PowerShell permission bypass: built-in `cd` functions (`cd..`, `cd\`, `cd~`, `X:`) changed the working directory undetected, letting a later command read outside the workspace
- Fixed the sandbox write allowlist in git worktrees covering the entire main repository root instead of only the shared `.git` directory (with `hooks/` and `config` denied)
- Fixed PowerShell prefix/wildcard allow rules (e.g. `PowerShell(dotnet.exe build *)`) not pre-approving native executables and scripts
- Fixed a permission-analysis gap where the parser trusted stale variable-tracking values for `PWD`/`OLDPWD`/`DIRSTACK` across `cd`/`pushd`/`popd`
- Fixed `find` in the Bash tool exhausting the macOS system file/vnode table and crashing the host on large directory trees
- Fixed the managed-settings approval dialog leaving the terminal frozen after accepting at startup
- Fixed `/ultraplan` and remote session creation failing with "Could not capture uncommitted changes" when the working tree has no real changes
- Fixed `otelHeadersHelper` failing silently when the script path contains spaces; helper failures are now reported in `/doctor` and the debug log

- Fixed collapsed Bash output reporting the wrong hidden-line count for outputs with many short lines
- Fixed slash-command argument-hint clipping trailing typed characters when the hint overflows the input box
- Fixed argument-hint and progressive arg suggestions not appearing after Tab-completing a skill whose frontmatter `name:` differs from its directory basename
- Fixed the status bar showing the user's baseline `/effort` setting instead of the effort level applied by skill/agent `effort:` frontmatter
- Fixed Ctrl+O transcript view freezing at the moment it was opened instead of tailing new messages
- Fixed editing a recalled prompt-history entry losing the edit when navigating further up/down with arrow keys
- Fixed `/config` exit summary reporting phantom changes to auto-compact and theme when toggling unrelated settings
- Fixed `/insights` crashing when cached session-meta files are missing optional fields
- Fixed malformed PowerShell and History tool calls with missing input being misclassified as reads in transcript collapsing
- Fixed renaming a Remote Control session from claude.ai or the Claude mobile app not updating the local session name for `claude --resume`
- Fixed a race where a just-submitted prompt could appear twice in the up-arrow history
- Fixed tapping the "Jump to bottom" pill in fullscreen mode not dismissing it immediately
- Improved `/feedback` reports to include the conversation that happened before context compaction, making issues from earlier in long sessions easier to triage

## 2.1.148

- Fixed the Bash tool returning exit code 127 on every command for some users (a regression introduced in 2.1.147)

## 2.1.147

- Pinned background sessions (`Ctrl+T` in `claude agents`) now stay alive when idle, are restarted in place to apply Claude Code updates, and are shed under memory pressure only after non-pinned sessions
- Renamed `/simplify` to `/code-review`. It now reports correctness bugs at a chosen effort level (e.g., `/code-review high`); pass `--comment` to post findings as inline GitHub PR comments. The old cleanup-and-fix behavior has been removed
- Improved auto-updater: retries transient network failures, reports specific error categories and OS error codes on failure, and shows the current version when an update fails
- Improved diff rendering performance for large file edits
- Prompt history no longer records consecutive duplicate entries — recalling a prompt with arrow-up and submitting it again won't add another copy
- Fixed enterprise login restrictions (`forceLoginOrgUUID` and `forceLoginMethod` managed-settings) not being enforced against third-party-provider and API-key sessions
- Fixed `&` in `!` command output displaying as `&amp;`, which broke copy-pasting URLs from commands like `gcloud auth login` on headless machines
- Fixed unknown slash commands silently doing nothing in headless/SDK mode — they now show an error message
- Fixed `/help` rendering a broken tab header and showing only one command per page on small terminals when not in fullscreen mode
- Fixed shell snapshot dropping user functions whose names start with a single underscore, which broke aliases referencing them
- Fixed plugin agents that declare multiple `Agent(...)` types in `tools:` frontmatter dropping all but the last entry
- Fixed hook `if` conditions like `PowerShell(git push*)` never matching — only `PowerShell(*)` worked

- Added `agent_id` and `parent_agent_id` attributes to `claude_code.tool` OTEL spans, and fixed trace parenting so background subagent spans nest under the dispatching Agent tool span
- Status line JSON input now includes GitHub repo and PR information when detected
- `/plugin` Discover and Browse screens now show a plugin's commands, agents, skills, hooks, and MCP/LSP servers before installation

- Added `/resume` support for background sessions — sessions started via `claude --bg` or agent view now appear alongside interactive ones, marked with `bg`
- Added elapsed duration to background subagent completion notifications (e.g. "Agent completed · 3h 2m 5s")
- The `/plugin` browse and discover panes now show when a plugin was last updated
- `/model` now changes the model for the current session only; press `d` in the model picker to set a default for new sessions
- Renamed "extra usage" to "usage credits" across CLI copy; `/extra-usage` is now `/usage-credits` (old name still works)
- Fixed startup hanging up to 75s when `api.anthropic.com` is unreachable (captive portal, firewall, VPN issues) — side-channel API calls now time out after 15s
- Fixed garbled terminal output after a missed window-resize event (e.g. dragging a VS Code split-pane divider) — now self-heals on the next frame instead of requiring Ctrl+L
- Fixed progressive terminal display corruption (stale/garbled glyphs) that could appear in very long sessions and only cleared on terminal resize or restart
- Reduced terminal rendering glitches in VS Code by reducing spinner animation color count
- Fixed macOS background sessions crashing with "exit 1 before init" when the project lives under a Full Disk Access-protected folder (regression in 2.1.143)
- Fixed an unrecoverable conversation when reading a file whose image extension doesn't match its contents (e.g. HTML saved as .png) — now falls back to text
- Fewer spurious tool errors during search: `head`/`tail` file views now satisfy the read-before-edit check, and a "no matches" result (exit code 1) from `egrep`, `fgrep`, `git grep`, or `git diff` is no longer reported as a command failure
- Fixed `/branch` failing with "No conversation to branch" after entering a worktree or in some background sessions
- Fixed pressing Escape in the AskUserQuestion notes field aborting the turn instead of returning to answer selection
- Fixed model selection not applying when changed via the IDE model picker or `applyFlagSettings` after startup

- Fixed session title being generated from plugin monitor output instead of the user's first prompt
- Fixed Skill tool failing with permission error in headless mode (regression in v2.1.141)
- Fixed plugins enabled in your own settings showing "not cached" errors after first load on a fresh machine; plugins enabled only by a project's `.claude/settings.json` now show an actionable `claude plugin install` hint
- Fixed `claude mcp list` silently reporting no servers when `.mcp.json` can't be parsed (e.g. using VS Code's `"servers"` key instead of `"mcpServers"`) — now shows configuration errors
- Fixed background side-queries on custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` setups and Bedrock Mantle not using Haiku — now falls back correctly when a first-party API key is configured or no Haiku model is set

- Fixed completed or stopped background sessions briefly failing to wake being permanently marked as a startup crash
- Fixed markdown links in `claude agents` attached sessions rendering as plain text instead of clickable hyperlinks
- Fixed custom `spinnerVerbs` applying to the post-turn duration message — past-tense built-ins like "Worked for 5s" are restored there

- `/plugin` now returns to the Installed list after enabling, disabling, or uninstalling a plugin
- `/doctor` now shows an exec-form example when a command hook is missing the `command` field
- Skill-listing truncation is no longer shown as a startup notification — run `/doctor` for the full breakdown
- Improved recovery from rare pre-response stream stalls — now retries streaming once instead of falling back to a slower non-streaming request
- Improved SDK/headless MCP startup: pre-wait now overlaps startup instead of blocking before the first turn (up to 2s faster with slow MCP servers)
- The post-survey follow-up hint now appears after every non-dismiss survey response with context-aware copy, making it easier to share more detail via /feedback.

## 2.1.143

- Added plugin dependency enforcement: `claude plugin disable` now refuses when another enabled plugin depends on the target (with a copy-pasteable disable-chain hint), and `claude plugin enable` force-enables transitive dependencies
- Added projected context cost (per-turn and per-invocation token estimates) to the `/plugin` marketplace browse pane
- Added `worktree.bgIsolation: "none"` setting to let background sessions edit the working copy directly without `EnterWorktree`, for repos where worktrees are impractical
- PowerShell tool now passes `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. Opt out with `CLAUDE_CODE_POWERSHELL_RESPECT_EXECUTION_POLICY=1`
- Background sessions now preserve the model and effort level you set after waking from idle
- Shift+Tab in attached agent sessions now includes auto mode in the cycle
- Fixed a corrupt `.credentials.json` with a non-array `scopes` value hanging the CLI on startup or silently aborting OAuth token refresh

- `claude agents` now accepts `--add-dir`, `--settings`, `--mcp-config`, and `--plugin-dir` and applies them to the dashboard and to background sessions dispatched from it
- `claude agents` accepts `--permission-mode`, `--model`, `--effort`, and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to set defaults for sessions dispatched from the view
- `claude --bg --dangerously-skip-permissions` now persists across retire→wake
- Fixed background sessions silently capturing IDE file references into the warm spare's input, which caused the reference to be prepended to the next prompt dispatched from `claude agents`

- Fixed background-job sessions on macOS getting "Operation not permitted" errors when reading files under `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, or `~/Downloads`, even with Full Disk Access granted.
- `/bg` now preserves `--mcp-config`, `--settings`, `--add-dir`, `--plugin-dir`, and `--strict-mcp-config`, so backgrounded sessions keep their MCP servers and settings across respawn.
- Background sessions launched from `claude agents` now honor `permissions.defaultMode` from settings.json (was previously overridden to auto mode)
- Fixed: on Windows, pressing ← in `claude agents` while a response was streaming could leave the agents list unresponsive to all input
- `/bg` and `←`-detach now preserve `--fallback-model`, so backgrounded workers degrade to the fallback model on overload instead of hard-failing.
- `/bg` and `←`-detach now preserve `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`, so the forked worker keeps bypass-permissions available in its Shift+Tab cycle.
- Fixed: background daemon spawn now falls back to the running binary when the `~/.local/bin/claude` launcher is missing or non-executable
- Fixed `claude agents --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` defaulting dispatched sessions to bypass mode instead of making it available in the permission cycle

## 2.1.142

- Fixed `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` not raising the per-request fetch timeout for remote HTTP and SSE MCP servers, which capped tool calls at 60 seconds regardless of the configured value
- Fixed background sessions not recognizing pre-existing git worktrees, blocking Edit while EnterWorktree refused to create a duplicate
- Fixed background sessions disappearing and daemon reconnect failing after macOS sleep/wake — the daemon now detects clock jumps instead of treating them as elapsed idle time

- Fixed background agents crash-looping when the Claude-in-Chrome extension is connected without a shared tab
- Fixed clicking links in an attached `claude agents` session — the background worker's headless browser shim no longer applies while attached

- Removed stale `/model claude-sonnet-4-20250514` suggestion from Usage Policy refusal messages

## 2.1.141

- Fixed `claude agents` opening a crashed session firing redundant dispatches when the working directory was deleted
- Fixed background jobs on a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateway not getting auto-named — the namer now uses the main model when no Haiku model is configured
- Fixed `/model` in one session silently changing the autocompact threshold in other concurrent sessions
- Fixed switching permission mode while a tool-permission prompt is open not auto-dismissing the prompt when the new setting permits the tool

## 2.1.139

- Added agent view (Research Preview): a single list of every Claude Code session — running, blocked on you, or done. Run `claude agents` to get started. See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-view
- Added `/goal` command: set a completion condition and Claude keeps working across turns until it's met. Works in interactive, `-p`, and Remote Control. Shows live elapsed/turns/tokens as an overlay panel

## 2.1.133

- Added `worktree.baseRef` setting (`fresh` | `head`) to choose whether `--worktree`, `EnterWorktree`, and agent-isolation worktrees branch from `origin/<default>` or local `HEAD`. **Note:** the default `fresh` changes `EnterWorktree`'s base back to `origin/<default>` (it has been local `HEAD` since 2.1.128) — set `worktree.baseRef: "head"` to keep unpushed commits in new worktrees
- Added `sandbox.bwrapPath` and `sandbox.socatPath` managed settings (Linux/WSL) to specify custom bubblewrap and socat binary locations
- Added `parentSettingsBehavior` admin-tier key (`'first-wins' | 'merge'`) to let admins opt SDK `managedSettings` (parent tier) into the policy merge

- Fixed Read/Write/Edit being denied on mapped network drives passed via `--add-dir` / SDK `additionalDirectories`
- Fixed Remote Control stop/interrupt from claude.ai not fully canceling the CLI session the same way local Esc does, causing queued messages to never advance after interrupting a stuck tool or prompt

- Added a "Pasting…" footer hint while a Ctrl+V image paste is being read from the clipboard
- Fixed external SIGINT (e.g. IDE stop button, `kill -INT`) not running graceful shutdown — terminal modes are now restored and the `--resume` hint is printed instead of an abrupt exit
- Fixed an uncaught exception when the terminal is closed or SSH disconnects mid-session under the native build
- Fixed `--resume` failing with `no low surrogate in string` when a tool error truncation split an emoji; pre-corrupted sessions are sanitized on load

- Updated `/model` picker: collapsed duplicate Opus 4.7 entries, and current Opus now shows as "Opus" instead of "Opus 4.7"
- Subprocesses (Bash, hooks, MCP, LSP) no longer inherit `OTEL_*` environment variables, so OTEL-instrumented apps run via the Bash tool no longer pick up the CLI's own OTLP endpoint
- MCP: `workspace` is now a reserved server name — existing servers with that name will be skipped with a warning
- Reconnecting MCP servers no longer flood the conversation with full tool-name lists on every reconnect — re-announced tools are summarized by server prefix
- SDK hosts now receive a persistent `localSettings` suggestion for Bash permission prompts, so "Always allow" writes to `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `EnterWorktree` now creates the new branch from local HEAD as documented, instead of `origin/<default-branch>` — unpushed commits are no longer dropped

- Fixed focus mode briefly dimming the previous response when submitting a new prompt
- Fixed stray "4;0;" desktop notification on every `/exit` in Kitty and other terminals that interpret OSC 9 as a notification

- Fixed `/fast` on 3P providers fuzzy-matching to an unrelated skill instead of showing "not available"
- Fixed Bedrock default model resolving to `global.*` instead of the region-appropriate prefix

- Fixed `/rename` without args failing on resumed sessions whose last entry is a compact boundary
- Fixed stale "remote-control is active" status lines from prior sessions appearing after `--resume`/`--continue`

- Fixed pasting an image larger than 2000px breaking the session — images are now downscaled on paste, and oversized images in history are automatically removed and the request retried
- Fixed showing the login screen for "OAuth not allowed for organization" errors — now shows guidance to contact your admin
- Fixed OAuth login failing with timeout on slow or proxied connections, in IPv6-only devcontainers, and when the browser callback can't reach localhost

Custom/MCP command names are redacted unless `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1` is set
- Native builds on macOS and Linux: the `Glob` and `Grep` tools are replaced by embedded `bfs` and `ugrep` available through the Bash tool — faster searches without a separate tool round-trip (Windows and npm-installed builds unchanged)
- Windows: cached `where.exe` executable lookups per process for faster subprocess launches
- Default effort for Pro/Max subscribers on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 is now `high` (was `medium`)

## 2.1.116

- `/resume` on large sessions is significantly faster (up to 67% on 40MB+ sessions) and handles sessions with many dead-fork entries more efficiently
- Faster MCP startup when multiple stdio servers are configured; `resources/templates/list` is now deferred to first `@`-mention
- Smoother fullscreen scrolling in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf terminals — `/terminal-setup` now configures the editor's scroll sensitivity

- Fixed terminal display tearing (random characters, drifting input) in iTerm2 + tmux setups when terminal notifications are sent
- Fixed `@` file suggestions re-scanning the entire project on every turn in non-git working directories, and showing only config files in freshly-initialized git repos with no tracked files
- Fixed LSP diagnostics from before an edit appearing after it, causing the model to re-read files it just edited

- Fixed MCP OAuth refresh never prompting for re-auth after the refresh token expires, for OAuth servers that return errors with HTTP 200 (e.g. Slack)
- Fixed voice mode silently failing on the macOS native binary for users whose terminal had never been granted microphone permission — the binary now includes the `audio-input` entitlement so macOS prompts correctly
- Fixed `SessionEnd` hooks being killed after 1.5 s on exit regardless of `hook.timeout` — now configurable via `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS`
- Fixed `/plugin install` failing inside the REPL for marketplace plugins with local sources

- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON` environment variable to immediately stop scheduled cron jobs mid-session
- Added `lsof`, `pgrep`, `tput`, `ss`, `fd`, and `fdfind` to the bash auto-approval allowlist, reducing permission prompts for common read-only operations
- Restored the `model` parameter on the Agent tool for per-invocation model overrides
- Simplified effort levels to low/medium/high (removed max) with new symbols (○ ◐ ●) and a brief notification instead of a persistent icon. Use `/effort auto` to reset to default

- Fixed bash security parsing edge cases
- Added support for marketplace git URLs without `.git` suffix (Azure DevOps, AWS CodeCommit)
- Improved marketplace clone failure messages to show diagnostic info even when git produces no stderr
- Fixed several plugin issues: installation failing on Windows with `EEXIST` error in OneDrive folders, marketplace blocking user-scope installs when a project-scope install exists, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` creating literal `~` directories, and `plugin.json` with marketplace-only fields failing to load
- Fixed feedback survey appearing too frequently in long sessions
- Fixed `--effort` CLI flag being reset by unrelated settings writes on startup
- Fixed backgrounded Ctrl+B queries losing their transcript or corrupting the new conversation after `/clear`
- Fixed `/clear` killing background agent/bash tasks — only foreground tasks are now cleared
- Fixed worktree isolation issues: Task tool resume not restoring cwd, and background task notifications missing `worktreePath` and `worktreeBranch`
- Fixed `/model` not displaying results when run while Claude is working

- Fixed intermittent "expected boolean, received string" validation errors on Edit, Bash, and Grep tool inputs
- Fixed multi-line session titles when forking from a conversation whose first message contained newlines
- Fixed queued messages not showing attached images, and images being lost when pressing ↑ to edit a queued message

- VSCode: Added effort level indicator on the input border
- VSCode: Added `vscode://anthropic.claude-code/open` URI handler to open a new Claude Code tab programmatically, with optional `prompt` and `session` query parameters

## 2.1.71

- Added `/loop` command to run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. `/loop 5m check the deploy`)
- Added cron scheduling tools for recurring prompts within a session
- Added `voice:pushToTalk` keybinding to make the voice activation key rebindable in `keybindings.json` (default: space) — modifier+letter combos like `meta+k` have zero typing interference
- Added `fmt`, `comm`, `cmp`, `numfmt`, `expr`, `test`, `printf`, `getconf`, `seq`, `tsort`, and `pr` to the bash auto-approval allowlist
- Fixed stdin freeze in long-running sessions where keystrokes stop being processed but the process stays alive
- Fixed a 5–8 second startup freeze for users with voice mode enabled, caused by CoreAudio initialization blocking the main thread after system wake
- Fixed startup UI freeze when many claude.ai proxy connectors refresh an expired OAuth token simultaneously
- Fixed forked conversations (`/fork`) sharing the same plan file, which caused plan edits in one fork to overwrite the other

- Fixed prompting for `cd <cwd> && git ...` on Windows when the model uses a mingw-style path
- Improved startup time by deferring native image processor loading to first use
- Improved bridge session reconnection to complete within seconds after laptop wake from sleep, instead of waiting up to 10 minutes
- Improved `/plugin uninstall` to disable project-scoped plugins in `.claude/settings.local.json` instead of modifying `.claude/settings.json`, so changes don't affect teammates
- Improved plugin-provided MCP server deduplication — servers that duplicate a manually-configured server (same command/URL) are now skipped, preventing duplicate connections and tool sets. Suppressions are shown in the `/plugin` menu.
- Updated `/debug` to toggle debug logging on mid-session, since debug logs are no longer written by default
- Removed startup notification noise for unauthenticated org-registered claude.ai connectors

## 2.1.70

- Fixed API 400 errors when using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with a third-party gateway — tool search now correctly detects proxy endpoints and disables `tool_reference` blocks
- Fixed `API Error: 400 This model does not support the effort parameter` when using custom Bedrock inference profiles or other model identifiers not matching standard Claude naming patterns
- Fixed empty model responses immediately after `ToolSearch` — the server renders tool schemas with system-prompt-style tags at the prompt tail, which could confuse models into stopping early
- Fixed prompt-cache bust when an MCP server with `instructions` connects after the first turn

- Fixed a performance regression in the `AskUserQuestion` preview dialog that re-ran markdown rendering on every keystroke in the notes input
- Fixed feature flags read during early startup never refreshing their disk cache, causing stale values to persist across sessions
- Fixed `permissions.defaultMode` settings values other than `acceptEdits` or `plan` being applied in Claude Code Remote environments — they are now ignored
- Fixed skill listing being re-injected on every `--resume` (~600 tokens saved per resume)
- Fixed teleport marker not rendering in VS Code teleported sessions
- Improved error message when microphone captures silence to distinguish from "no speech detected"
- Improved compaction to preserve images in the summarizer request, allowing prompt cache reuse for faster and cheaper compaction
- Improved `/rename` to work while Claude is processing, instead of being silently queued
- Reduced prompt input re-renders during turns by ~74%
- Reduced startup memory by ~426KB for users without custom CA certificates
- Reduced Remote Control `/poll` rate to once per 10 minutes while connected (was 1–2s), cutting server load ~300×. Reconnection is unaffected — transport loss immediately wakes fast polling.
- [VSCode] Added spark icon in VS Code activity bar that lists all Claude Code sessions, with sessions opening as full editors
- [VSCode] Added full markdown document view for plans in VS Code, with support for adding comments to provide feedback
- [VSCode] Added native MCP server management dialog — use `/mcp` in the chat panel to enable/disable servers, reconnect, and manage OAuth authentication without switching to the terminal

- Fixed `--model claude-opus-4-0` and `--model claude-opus-4-1` resolving to deprecated Opus versions instead of current
- Fixed macOS keychain corruption when using multiple OAuth MCP servers. Large OAuth metadata blobs could overflow the `security -i` stdin buffer, silently leaving stale credentials behind and causing repeated `/login` prompts.
- Fixed `.credentials.json` losing `subscriptionType` (showing "Claude API" instead of "Claude Pro"/"Claude Max") when the profile endpoint transiently fails during token refresh (anthropics/claude-code#30185)

- Fixed teammates accidentally spawning nested teammates via the Agent tool's `name` parameter
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` being ignored during conversation compaction
- Fixed `/compact` summary rendering as a user bubble in SDK consumers (Claude Code Remote web UI, VSCode extension)
- Fixed voice space bar getting stuck after a failed voice activation (module loading race, cold GrowthBook)
- Fixed worktree file copy on Windows
- Fixed global `.claude` folder detection on Windows
- Fixed symlink bypass where writing new files through a symlinked parent directory could escape the working directory in `acceptEdits` mode
- Fixed sandbox prompting users to approve non-allowed domains when `allowManagedDomainsOnly` is enabled in managed settings — non-allowed domains are now blocked automatically with no bypass
- Fixed interactive tools (e.g., `AskUserQuestion`) being silently auto-allowed when listed in a skill's allowed-tools, bypassing the permission prompt and running with empty answers
- Fixed multi-GB memory spike when committing with large untracked binary files in the working tree
- Fixed Escape not interrupting a running turn when the input box has draft text. Use Up arrow to pull queued messages back for editing, or Ctrl+U to clear the input line.

- Fixed a memory leak where old message array versions accumulated in React Compiler `memoCache` over long sessions
- Fixed a memory leak where REPL render scopes accumulated over long sessions (~35MB over 1000 turns)

- Fixed hang when `--mcp-config` points to a corrupted file
- Fixed slow startup when many skills/plugins are installed
- Fixed `cd <outside-dir> && <cmd>` permission prompt to surface the chained command instead of only showing "Yes, allow reading from <dir>/"
- Fixed conditional `.claude/rules/*.md` files (with `paths:` frontmatter) and nested CLAUDE.md files not loading in print mode (`claude -p`)

- Fixed service key OAuth sessions (CCR containers) spamming `[ERROR]` logs with 403s from profile-scoped endpoints
- Fixed inconsistent color for "Remote Control active" status indicator
- Fixed Voice waveform cursor covering the first suffix letter when dictating mid-input
- Fixed Voice input showing all 5 spaces during warmup instead of capping at ~2 (aligning with the "keep holding…" hint)
- Improved spinner performance by isolating the 50ms animation loop from the surrounding shell, reducing render and CPU overhead during turns
- Improved UI rendering performance in native binaries with React Compiler
- Improved `--worktree` startup by eliminating a git subprocess on the startup path
- Improved macOS startup by eliminating redundant settings-file reloads when managed settings resolve
- Improved macOS startup for Claude.ai enterprise/team users by skipping an unnecessary keychain lookup
- Improved MCP `-p` startup by pipelining claude.ai config fetch with local connections and using a concurrency pool instead of sequential batching
- Improved voice startup by removing imperceptible warmup pulse animations that were causing re-render stutter
- Improved MCP binary content handling: tools returning PDFs, Office documents, or audio now save decoded bytes to disk with the correct file extension instead of dumping raw base64 into the conversation context. WebFetch also saves binary responses alongside its summary.

- Improved LSP tool rendering and memory context building to no longer read entire files
- Improved session upload and memory sync to avoid reading large files into memory before size/binary checks
- Improved file operation performance by avoiding reading file contents for existence checks (6 sites)

- [VSCode] Added compaction display as a collapsible "Compacted chat" card with the summary inside
- [VSCode] The permission mode picker now respects `permissions.disableBypassPermissionsMode` from your effective Claude Code settings (including managed/policy settings) — when set to `disable`, bypass permissions mode is hidden from the picker
- [VSCode] Fixed RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian) rendering reversed in the chat panel (regression in v2.1.63)

## 2.1.68

- Opus 4.6 now defaults to medium effort for Max and Team subscribers. Medium effort works well for most tasks — it's the sweet spot between speed and thoroughness. You can change this anytime with `/model`
- Re-introduced the "ultrathink" keyword to enable high effort for the next turn
- Removed Opus 4 and 4.1 from Claude Code on the first-party API — users with these models pinned are automatically moved to Opus 4.6

- Fixed memory leak where long-running teammates retained all messages in AppState even after conversation compaction
- Fixed a memory leak where MCP server fetch caches were not cleared on disconnect, causing growing memory usage with servers that reconnect frequently
- Improved memory usage in long sessions with subagents by stripping heavy progress message payloads during context compaction
- Added "Always copy full response" option to the `/copy` picker. When selected, future `/copy` commands will skip the code block picker and copy the full response directly.
- VSCode: Added session rename and remove actions to the sessions list
- Fixed `/clear` not resetting cached skills, which could cause stale skill content to persist in the new conversation

## 2.1.62

- Improved ordering of short task lists
- Improved memory usage in multi-agent sessions by releasing completed subagent task state
- Fixed MCP OAuth token refresh race condition when running multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously

- Fixed BashTool failing on Windows with EINVAL error

## 2.1.53

- Fixed a UI flicker where user input would briefly disappear after submission before the message rendered
