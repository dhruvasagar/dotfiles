**The performance optimization system for AI agent harnesses. From an Anthropic hackathon winner.**

Not just configs. A complete system: skills, instincts, memory optimization, continuous learning, security scanning, and research-first development. Production-ready agents, hooks, commands, rules, and MCP configurations evolved over 10+ months of intensive daily use building real products.

Works across **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cowork**, and other AI agent harnesses.

## What's New

### v1.8.0 — Harness Performance System (Mar 2026)

- **Harness-first release** — ECC is now explicitly framed as an agent harness performance system, not just a config pack.
- **Hook reliability overhaul** — SessionStart root fallback, Stop-phase session summaries, and script-based hooks replacing fragile inline one-liners.
- **Hook runtime controls** — `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal|standard|strict` and `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS=...` for runtime gating without editing hook files.
- **New harness commands** — `/harness-audit`, `/loop-start`, `/loop-status`, `/quality-gate`, `/model-route`.
- **NanoClaw v2** — model routing, skill hot-load, session branch/search/export/compact/metrics.
- **Cross-harness parity** — behavior tightened across Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, and Codex app/CLI.
- **997 internal tests passing** — full suite green after hook/runtime refactor and compatibility updates.

### v1.7.0 — Cross-Platform Expansion & Presentation Builder (Feb 2026)

- **Codex app + CLI support** — Direct `AGENTS.md`-based Codex support, installer targeting, and Codex docs
- **`frontend-slides` skill** — Zero-dependency HTML presentation builder with PPTX conversion guidance and strict viewport-fit rules
- **5 new generic business/content skills** — `article-writing`, `content-engine`, `market-research`, `investor-materials`, `investor-outreach`
- **Broader tool coverage** — Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode support tightened so the same repo ships cleanly across all major harnesses
- **992 internal tests** — Expanded validation and regression coverage across plugin, hooks, skills, and packaging

### v1.6.0 — Codex CLI, AgentShield & Marketplace (Feb 2026)

- **Codex CLI support** — New `/codex-setup` command generates `codex.md` for OpenAI Codex CLI compatibility
- **7 new skills** — `search-first`, `swift-actor-persistence`, `swift-protocol-di-testing`, `regex-vs-llm-structured-text`, `content-hash-cache-pattern`, `cost-aware-llm-pipeline`, `skill-stocktake`
- **AgentShield integration** — `/security-scan` skill runs AgentShield directly from Claude Code; 1282 tests, 102 rules
- **GitHub Marketplace** — ECC Tools GitHub App live at [github.com/marketplace/ecc-tools](https://github.com/marketplace/ecc-tools) with free/pro/enterprise tiers
- **30+ community PRs merged** — Contributions from 30 contributors across 6 languages
- **978 internal tests** — Expanded validation suite across agents, skills, commands, hooks, and rules

### v1.4.1 — Bug Fix (Feb 2026)

- **Fixed instinct import content loss** — `parse_instinct_file()` was silently dropping all content after frontmatter (Action, Evidence, Examples sections) during `/instinct-import`. Fixed by community contributor @ericcai0814 ([#148](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/148), [#161](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/pull/161))

### v1.4.0 — Multi-Language Rules, Installation Wizard & PM2 (Feb 2026)

- **Interactive installation wizard** — New `configure-ecc` skill provides guided setup with merge/overwrite detection
- **PM2 & multi-agent orchestration** — 6 new commands (`/pm2`, `/multi-plan`, `/multi-execute`, `/multi-backend`, `/multi-frontend`, `/multi-workflow`) for managing complex multi-service workflows
- **Multi-language rules architecture** — Rules restructured from flat files into `common/` + `typescript/` + `python/` + `golang/` directories. Install only the languages you need
- **Chinese (zh-CN) translations** — Complete translation of all agents, commands, skills, and rules (80+ files)
- **GitHub Sponsors support** — Sponsor the project via GitHub Sponsors
- **Enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md** — Detailed PR templates for each contribution type

### v1.3.0 — OpenCode Plugin Support (Feb 2026)

- **Full OpenCode integration** — 12 agents, 24 commands, 16 skills with hook support via OpenCode's plugin system (20+ event types)
- **3 native custom tools** — run-tests, check-coverage, security-audit
- **LLM documentation** — `llms.txt` for comprehensive OpenCode docs

### v1.2.0 — Unified Commands & Skills (Feb 2026)

- **Python/Django support** — Django patterns, security, TDD, and verification skills
- **Java Spring Boot skills** — Patterns, security, TDD, and verification for Spring Boot
- **Session management** — `/sessions` command for session history
- **Continuous learning v2** — Instinct-based learning with confidence scoring, import/export, evolution

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in under 2 minutes:

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

# Install plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

### Step 2: Install Rules (Required)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Claude Code plugins cannot distribute `rules` automatically. Install them manually:

```bash
# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git
cd everything-claude-code

# Install dependencies (pick your package manager)
npm install        # or: pnpm install | yarn install | bun install

# macOS/Linux
./install.sh typescript    # or python or golang or swift or php
# ./install.sh typescript python golang swift php
# ./install.sh --target cursor typescript
# ./install.sh --target antigravity typescript
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\install.ps1 typescript   # or python or golang or swift or php
# .\install.ps1 typescript python golang swift php
# .\install.ps1 --target cursor typescript
# .\install.ps1 --target antigravity typescript

# npm-installed compatibility entrypoint also works cross-platform
npx ecc-install typescript
```

For manual install instructions see the README in the `rules/` folder.

### Step 3: Start Using

```bash
# Try a command (plugin install uses namespaced form)
/everything-claude-code:plan "Add user authentication"

# Manual install (Option 2) uses the shorter form:
# /plan "Add user authentication"

# Check available commands
/plugin list everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

✨ **That's it!** You now have access to 25 agents, 108 skills, and 57 commands.

## 🌐 Cross-Platform Support

This plugin now fully supports **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, alongside tight integration across major IDEs (Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity) and CLI harnesses. All hooks and scripts have been rewritten in Node.js for maximum compatibility.

### Package Manager Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) with the following priority:

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/package-manager.json`
3. **package.json**: `packageManager` field
4. **Lock file**: Detection from package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb
5. **Global config**: `~/.claude/package-manager.json`
6. **Fallback**: First available package manager

To set your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm

# Via global config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --global pnpm

# Via project config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --project bun

# Detect current setting
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect
```

Or use the `/setup-pm` command in Claude Code.

### Hook Runtime Controls

Use runtime flags to tune strictness or disable specific hooks temporarily:

```bash
# Hook strictness profile (default: standard)
export ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=standard

# Comma-separated hook IDs to disable
export ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS="pre:bash:tmux-reminder,post:edit:typecheck"
```

## 🛠️ Ecosystem Tools

### Skill Creator

Two ways to generate Claude Code skills from your repository:

#### Option A: Local Analysis (Built-in)

Use the `/skill-create` command for local analysis without external services:

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning
```

This analyzes your git history locally and generates SKILL.md files.

#### Option B: GitHub App (Advanced)

For advanced features (10k+ commits, auto-PRs, team sharing):

[Install GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator) | [ecc.tools](https://ecc.tools)

```bash
# Comment on any issue:
/skill-creator analyze

# Or auto-triggers on push to default branch
```

Both options create:
- **SKILL.md files** - Ready-to-use skills for Claude Code
- **Instinct collections** - For continuous-learning-v2
- **Pattern extraction** - Learns from your commit history

### AgentShield — Security Auditor

> Built at the Claude Code Hackathon (Cerebral Valley x Anthropic, Feb 2026). 1282 tests, 98% coverage, 102 static analysis rules.

Scan your Claude Code configuration for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and injection risks.

```bash
# Quick scan (no install needed)
npx ecc-agentshield scan

# Auto-fix safe issues
npx ecc-agentshield scan --fix

# Deep analysis with three Opus 4.6 agents
npx ecc-agentshield scan --opus --stream

# Generate secure config from scratch
npx ecc-agentshield init
```

**What it scans:** CLAUDE.md, settings.json, MCP configs, hooks, agent definitions, and skills across 5 categories — secrets detection (14 patterns), permission auditing, hook injection analysis, MCP server risk profiling, and agent config review.

**The `--opus` flag** runs three Claude Opus 4.6 agents in a red-team/blue-team/auditor pipeline. The attacker finds exploit chains, the defender evaluates protections, and the auditor synthesizes both into a prioritized risk assessment. Adversarial reasoning, not just pattern matching.

**Output formats:** Terminal (color-graded A-F), JSON (CI pipelines), Markdown, HTML. Exit code 2 on critical findings for build gates.

Use `/security-scan` in Claude Code to run it, or add to CI with the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/affaan-m/agentshield).

[GitHub](https://github.com/affaan-m/agentshield) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecc-agentshield)

### 🔬 Plankton — Write-Time Code Quality Enforcement

Plankton (credit: @alxfazio) is a recommended companion for write-time code quality enforcement. It runs formatters and 20+ linters on every file edit via PostToolUse hooks, then spawns Claude subprocesses (routed to Haiku/Sonnet/Opus by violation complexity) to fix issues the main agent missed. Three-phase architecture: auto-format silently (40-50% of issues), collect remaining violations as structured JSON, delegate fixes to a subprocess. Includes config protection hooks that prevent agents from modifying linter configs to pass instead of fixing code. Supports Python, TypeScript, Shell, YAML, JSON, TOML, Markdown, and Dockerfile. Use alongside AgentShield for security + quality coverage. See `skills/plankton-code-quality/` for full integration guide.

### 🧠 Continuous Learning v2

The instinct-based learning system automatically learns your patterns:

```bash
/instinct-status        # Show learned instincts with confidence
/instinct-import <file> # Import instincts from others
/instinct-export        # Export your instincts for sharing
/evolve                 # Cluster related instincts into skills
```

See `skills/continuous-learning-v2/` for full documentation.

## 📋 Requirements

### Claude Code CLI Version

**Minimum version: v2.1.0 or later**

This plugin requires Claude Code CLI v2.1.0+ due to changes in how the plugin system handles hooks.

Check your version:
```bash
claude --version
```

### Important: Hooks Auto-Loading Behavior

> ⚠️ **For Contributors:** Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is enforced by a regression test.

Claude Code v2.1+ **automatically loads** `hooks/hooks.json` from any installed plugin by convention. Explicitly declaring it in `plugin.json` causes a duplicate detection error:

```
Duplicate hooks file detected: ./hooks/hooks.json resolves to already-loaded file
```

**History:** This has caused repeated fix/revert cycles in this repo ([#29](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/29), [#52](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/52), [#103](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/103)). The behavior changed between Claude Code versions, leading to confusion. We now have a regression test to prevent this from being reintroduced.

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this repo - install as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

# Install the plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

Or add directly to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "everything-claude-code": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "affaan-m/everything-claude-code"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code": true
  }
}
```

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

> **Note:** The Claude Code plugin system does not support distributing `rules` via plugins ([upstream limitation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)). You need to install rules manually:
>
> ```bash
> # Clone the repo first
> git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git
>
> # Option A: User-level rules (applies to all projects)
> mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/typescript/* ~/.claude/rules/   # pick your stack
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/python/* ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/golang/* ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/php/* ~/.claude/rules/
>
> # Option B: Project-level rules (applies to current project only)
> mkdir -p .claude/rules
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* .claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/typescript/* .claude/rules/     # pick your stack
> ```

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"]
model: opus
---

You are a senior code reviewer...
```

### Skills

Skills are workflow definitions invoked by commands or agents:

```markdown
# TDD Workflow

1. Define interfaces first
2. Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
4. Refactor (IMPROVE)
5. Verify 80%+ coverage
```

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "#!/bin/bash\ngrep -n 'console\\.log' \"$file_path\" && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2"
  }]
}
```

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines, organized into `common/` (language-agnostic) + language-specific directories:

```
rules/
  common/          # Universal principles (always install)
  typescript/      # TS/JS specific patterns and tools
  python/          # Python specific patterns and tools
  golang/          # Go specific patterns and tools
  swift/           # Swift specific patterns and tools
  php/             # PHP specific patterns and tools
```

See [`rules/README.md`](rules/README.md) for installation and structure details.

## 🗺️ Which Agent Should I Use?

Not sure where to start? Use this quick reference:

| I want to... | Use this command | Agent used |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Plan a new feature | `/everything-claude-code:plan "Add auth"` | planner |
| Design system architecture | `/everything-claude-code:plan` + architect agent | architect |
| Write code with tests first | `/tdd` | tdd-guide |
| Review code I just wrote | `/code-review` | code-reviewer |
| Fix a failing build | `/build-fix` | build-error-resolver |
| Run end-to-end tests | `/e2e` | e2e-runner |
| Find security vulnerabilities | `/security-scan` | security-reviewer |
| Remove dead code | `/refactor-clean` | refactor-cleaner |
| Update documentation | `/update-docs` | doc-updater |
| Review Go code | `/go-review` | go-reviewer |
| Review Python code | `/python-review` | python-reviewer |
| Audit database queries | *(auto-delegated)* | database-reviewer |

### Common Workflows

**Starting a new feature:**
```
/everything-claude-code:plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
                                              → planner creates implementation blueprint
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide enforces write-tests-first
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer checks your work
```

**Fixing a bug:**
```
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide: write a failing test that reproduces it
                                              → implement the fix, verify test passes
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer: catch regressions
```

**Preparing for production:**
```
/security-scan                                → security-reviewer: OWASP Top 10 audit
/e2e                                          → e2e-runner: critical user flow tests
/test-coverage                                → verify 80%+ coverage
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How do I check which agents/commands are installed?</b></summary>

```bash
/plugin list everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

This shows all available agents, commands, and skills from the plugin.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My hooks aren't working / I see "Duplicate hooks file" errors</b></summary>

This is the most common issue. **Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.** Claude Code v2.1+ automatically loads `hooks/hooks.json` from installed plugins. Explicitly declaring it causes duplicate detection errors. See [#29](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/29), [#52](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/52), [#103](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/103).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use ECC with Claude Code on a custom API endpoint or model gateway?</b></summary>

Yes. ECC does not hardcode Anthropic-hosted transport settings. It runs locally through Claude Code's normal CLI/plugin surface, so it works with:

- Anthropic-hosted Claude Code
- Official Claude Code gateway setups using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Compatible custom endpoints that speak the Anthropic API Claude Code expects

Minimal example:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-gateway.example.com
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
claude
```

If your gateway remaps model names, configure that in Claude Code rather than in ECC. ECC's hooks, skills, commands, and rules are model-provider agnostic once the `claude` CLI is already working.

Official references:
- [Claude Code LLM gateway docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/llm-gateway)
- [Claude Code model configuration docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/model-config)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My context window is shrinking / Claude is running out of context</b></summary>

Too many MCP servers eat your context. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.

**Fix:** Disable unused MCPs per project:
```json
// In your project's .claude/settings.json
{
  "disabledMcpServers": ["supabase", "railway", "vercel"]
}
```

Keep under 10 MCPs enabled and under 80 tools active.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use only some components (e.g., just agents)?</b></summary>

Yes. Use Option 2 (manual installation) and copy only what you need:

```bash
# Just agents
cp everything-claude-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Just rules
cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* ~/.claude/rules/
```

Each component is fully independent.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this work with Cursor / OpenCode / Codex / Antigravity?</b></summary>

Yes. ECC is cross-platform:
- **Cursor**: Pre-translated configs in `.cursor/`. See [Cursor IDE Support](#cursor-ide-support).
- **OpenCode**: Full plugin support in `.opencode/`. See [OpenCode Support](#-opencode-support).
- **Codex**: First-class support for both macOS app and CLI, with adapter drift guards and SessionStart fallback. See PR [#257](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/pull/257).
- **Antigravity**: Tightly integrated setup for workflows, skills, and flatten rules in `.agent/`.
- **Claude Code**: Native — this is the primary target.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I contribute a new skill or agent?</b></summary>

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create your skill in `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` (with YAML frontmatter)
3. Or create an agent in `agents/your-agent.md`
4. Submit a PR with a clear description of what it does and when to use it

---

## Cursor IDE Support

ECC provides **full Cursor IDE support** with hooks, rules, agents, skills, commands, and MCP configs adapted for Cursor's native format.

### Quick Start (Cursor)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./install.sh --target cursor typescript
./install.sh --target cursor python golang swift php
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\install.ps1 --target cursor typescript
.\install.ps1 --target cursor python golang swift php
```

### What's Included

| Component | Count | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Hook Events | 15 | sessionStart, beforeShellExecution, afterFileEdit, beforeMCPExecution, beforeSubmitPrompt, and 10 more |
| Hook Scripts | 16 | Thin Node.js scripts delegating to `scripts/hooks/` via shared adapter |
| Rules | 34 | 9 common (alwaysApply) + 25 language-specific (TypeScript, Python, Go, Swift, PHP) |
| Agents | Shared | Via AGENTS.md at root (read by Cursor natively) |
| Skills | Shared + Bundled | Via AGENTS.md at root and `.cursor/skills/` for translated additions |
| Commands | Shared | `.cursor/commands/` if installed |
| MCP Config | Shared | `.cursor/mcp.json` if installed |

### Hook Architecture (DRY Adapter Pattern)

Cursor has **more hook events than Claude Code** (20 vs 8). The `.cursor/hooks/adapter.js` module transforms Cursor's stdin JSON to Claude Code's format, allowing existing `scripts/hooks/*.js` to be reused without duplication.

```
Cursor stdin JSON → adapter.js → transforms → scripts/hooks/*.js
                                              (shared with Claude Code)
```

Key hooks:
- **beforeShellExecution** — Blocks dev servers outside tmux (exit 2), git push review
- **afterFileEdit** — Auto-format + TypeScript check + console.log warning
- **beforeSubmitPrompt** — Detects secrets (sk-, ghp_, AKIA patterns) in prompts
- **beforeTabFileRead** — Blocks Tab from reading .env, .key, .pem files (exit 2)
- **beforeMCPExecution / afterMCPExecution** — MCP audit logging

### Rules Format

Cursor rules use YAML frontmatter with `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply`:

```yaml
---
description: "TypeScript coding style extending common rules"
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

---

## Codex macOS App + CLI Support

ECC provides **first-class Codex support** for both the macOS app and CLI, with a reference configuration, Codex-specific AGENTS.md supplement, and shared skills.

### Quick Start (Codex App + CLI)

```bash
# Run Codex CLI in the repo — AGENTS.md and .codex/ are auto-detected
codex

# Optional: copy the global-safe defaults to your home directory
cp .codex/config.toml ~/.codex/config.toml
```

Codex macOS app:
- Open this repository as your workspace.
- The root `AGENTS.md` is auto-detected.
- `.codex/config.toml` and `.codex/agents/*.toml` work best when kept project-local.
- The reference `.codex/config.toml` intentionally does not pin `model` or `model_provider`, so Codex uses its own current default unless you override it.
- Optional: copy `.codex/config.toml` to `~/.codex/config.toml` for global defaults; keep the multi-agent role files project-local unless you also copy `.codex/agents/`.

### What's Included

| Component | Count | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Config | 1 | `.codex/config.toml` — top-level approvals/sandbox/web_search, MCP servers, notifications, profiles |
| AGENTS.md | 2 | Root (universal) + `.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex-specific supplement) |
| Skills | 16 | `.agents/skills/` — SKILL.md + agents/openai.yaml per skill |
| MCP Servers | 4 | GitHub, Context7, Memory, Sequential Thinking (command-based) |
| Profiles | 2 | `strict` (read-only sandbox) and `yolo` (full auto-approve) |
| Agent Roles | 3 | `.codex/agents/` — explorer, reviewer, docs-researcher |

### Skills

Skills at `.agents/skills/` are auto-loaded by Codex:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| tdd-workflow | Test-driven development with 80%+ coverage |
| security-review | Comprehensive security checklist |
| coding-standards | Universal coding standards |
| frontend-patterns | React/Next.js patterns |
| frontend-slides | HTML presentations, PPTX conversion, visual style exploration |
| article-writing | Long-form writing from notes and voice references |
| content-engine | Platform-native social content and repurposing |
| market-research | Source-attributed market and competitor research |
| investor-materials | Decks, memos, models, and one-pagers |
| investor-outreach | Personalized outreach, follow-ups, and intro blurbs |
| backend-patterns | API design, database, caching |
| e2e-testing | Playwright E2E tests |
| eval-harness | Eval-driven development |
| strategic-compact | Context management |
| api-design | REST API design patterns |
| verification-loop | Build, test, lint, typecheck, security |

### Key Limitation

Codex does **not yet provide Claude-style hook execution parity**. ECC enforcement there is instruction-based via `AGENTS.md`, optional `model_instructions_file` overrides, and sandbox/approval settings.

### Multi-Agent Support

Current Codex builds support experimental multi-agent workflows.

- Enable `features.multi_agent = true` in `.codex/config.toml`
- Define roles under `[agents.<name>]`
- Point each role at a file under `.codex/agents/`
- Use `/agent` in the CLI to inspect or steer child agents

ECC ships three sample role configs:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `explorer` | Read-only codebase evidence gathering before edits |
| `reviewer` | Correctness, security, and missing-test review |
| `docs_researcher` | Documentation and API verification before release/docs changes |

---

## 🔌 OpenCode Support

ECC provides **full OpenCode support** including plugins and hooks.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install OpenCode
npm install -g opencode

# Run in the repository root
opencode
```

The configuration is automatically detected from `.opencode/opencode.json`.

### Feature Parity

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenCode | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Agents | ✅ 25 agents | ✅ 12 agents | **Claude Code leads** |
| Commands | ✅ 57 commands | ✅ 31 commands | **Claude Code leads** |
| Skills | ✅ 108 skills | ✅ 37 skills | **Claude Code leads** |
| Hooks | ✅ 8 event types | ✅ 11 events | **OpenCode has more!** |
| Rules | ✅ 29 rules | ✅ 13 instructions | **Claude Code leads** |
| MCP Servers | ✅ 14 servers | ✅ Full | **Full parity** |
| Custom Tools | ✅ Via hooks | ✅ 6 native tools | **OpenCode is better** |

### Hook Support via Plugins

OpenCode's plugin system is MORE sophisticated than Claude Code with 20+ event types:

| Claude Code Hook | OpenCode Plugin Event |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| PreToolUse | `tool.execute.before` |
| PostToolUse | `tool.execute.after` |
| Stop | `session.idle` |
| SessionStart | `session.created` |
| SessionEnd | `session.deleted` |

**Additional OpenCode events**: `file.edited`, `file.watcher.updated`, `message.updated`, `lsp.client.diagnostics`, `tui.toast.show`, and more.

### Plugin Installation

**Option 1: Use directly**
```bash
cd everything-claude-code
opencode
```

**Option 2: Install as npm package**
```bash
npm install ecc-universal
```

Then add to your `opencode.json`:
```json
{
  "plugin": ["ecc-universal"]
}
```

That npm plugin entry enables ECC's published OpenCode plugin module (hooks/events and plugin tools).
It does **not** automatically add ECC's full command/agent/instruction catalog to your project config.

For the full ECC OpenCode setup, either:
- run OpenCode inside this repository, or
- copy the bundled `.opencode/` config assets into your project and wire the `instructions`, `agent`, and `command` entries in `opencode.json`

## Cross-Tool Feature Parity

ECC is the **first plugin to maximize every major AI coding tool**. Here's how each harness compares:

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor IDE | Codex CLI | OpenCode |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Agents** | 21 | Shared (AGENTS.md) | Shared (AGENTS.md) | 12 |
| **Commands** | 52 | Shared | Instruction-based | 31 |
| **Skills** | 102 | Shared | 10 (native format) | 37 |
| **Hook Events** | 8 types | 15 types | None yet | 11 types |
| **Hook Scripts** | 20+ scripts | 16 scripts (DRY adapter) | N/A | Plugin hooks |
| **Rules** | 34 (common + lang) | 34 (YAML frontmatter) | Instruction-based | 13 instructions |
| **Custom Tools** | Via hooks | Via hooks | N/A | 6 native tools |
| **MCP Servers** | 14 | Shared (mcp.json) | 4 (command-based) | Full |
| **Config Format** | settings.json | hooks.json + rules/ | config.toml | opencode.json |
| **Context File** | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md |
| **Secret Detection** | Hook-based | beforeSubmitPrompt hook | Sandbox-based | Hook-based |
| **Auto-Format** | PostToolUse hook | afterFileEdit hook | N/A | file.edited hook |
| **Version** | Plugin | Plugin | Reference config | 1.8.0 |

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **AGENTS.md** at root is the universal cross-tool file (read by all 4 tools)
- **DRY adapter pattern** lets Cursor reuse Claude Code's hook scripts without duplication
- **Skills format** (SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter) works across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode
- Codex's lack of hooks is compensated by `AGENTS.md`, optional `model_instructions_file` overrides, and sandbox permissions

## 📖 Background

I've been using Claude Code since the experimental rollout. Won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon in Sep 2025 building [zenith.chat](https://zenith.chat) with [@DRodriguezFX](https://x.com/DRodriguezFX) - entirely using Claude Code.

These configs are battle-tested across multiple production applications.

## Token Optimization

Claude Code usage can be expensive if you don't manage token consumption. These settings significantly reduce costs without sacrificing quality.

### Recommended Settings

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "env": {
    "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS": "10000",
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50"
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Recommended | Impact |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `model` | opus | **sonnet** | ~60% cost reduction; handles 80%+ of coding tasks |
| `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` | 31,999 | **10,000** | ~70% reduction in hidden thinking cost per request |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | 95 | **50** | Compacts earlier — better quality in long sessions |

Switch to Opus only when you need deep architectural reasoning:
```
/model opus
```

### Daily Workflow Commands

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model sonnet` | Default for most tasks |
| `/model opus` | Complex architecture, debugging, deep reasoning |
| `/clear` | Between unrelated tasks (free, instant reset) |
| `/compact` | At logical task breakpoints (research done, milestone complete) |
| `/cost` | Monitor token spending during session |

### Strategic Compaction

The `strategic-compact` skill (included in this plugin) suggests `/compact` at logical breakpoints instead of relying on auto-compaction at 95% context. See `skills/strategic-compact/SKILL.md` for the full decision guide.

**When to compact:**
- After research/exploration, before implementation
- After completing a milestone, before starting the next
- After debugging, before continuing feature work
- After a failed approach, before trying a new one

**When NOT to compact:**
- Mid-implementation (you'll lose variable names, file paths, partial state)

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.

- Keep under 10 MCPs enabled per project
- Keep under 80 tools active
- Use `disabledMcpServers` in project config to disable unused ones

### Agent Teams Cost Warning

Agent Teams spawns multiple context windows. Each teammate consumes tokens independently. Only use for tasks where parallelism provides clear value (multi-module work, parallel reviews). For simple sequential tasks, subagents are more token-efficient.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Token Optimization

Hitting daily limits? See the **[Token Optimization Guide](docs/token-optimization.md)** for recommended settings and workflow tips.

Quick wins:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "env": {
    "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS": "10000",
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL": "haiku"
  }
}
```

Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks, `/compact` at logical breakpoints, and `/cost` to monitor spending.

### Customization

These configs work for my workflow. You should:
1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
