## What problem are you trying to solve?
<!-- Describe the specific problem you encountered. If this was a session
     issue, include: what you were doing, what went wrong, the model's
     exact failure mode, and ideally a transcript or session log.

     "Improving" something is not a problem statement. What broke? What
     failed? What was the user experience that motivated this? -->

## What does this PR change?
<!-- 1-3 sentences. What, not why — the "why" belongs above. -->

## Is this change appropriate for the core library?
<!-- Superpowers core contains general-purpose skills and infrastructure
     that benefit all users. Ask yourself:

     - Would this be useful to someone working on a completely different
       kind of project than yours?
     - Is this project-specific, team-specific, or tool-specific?
     - Does this integrate or promote a third-party service?

     If your change is a new skill for a specific domain, workflow tool,
     or third-party integration, it belongs in its own plugin — not here.
     See the plugin development docs for how to publish it separately. -->

## What alternatives did you consider?
<!-- What other approaches did you try or evaluate before landing on this
     one? Why were they worse? If you didn't consider alternatives, say so
     — but know that's a red flag. -->

## Does this PR contain multiple unrelated changes?
<!-- If yes: stop. Split it into separate PRs. Bundled PRs will be closed.
     If you believe the changes are related, explain the dependency. -->

- [ ] I have reviewed all open AND closed PRs for duplicates or prior art

## Environment tested

| Harness (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor) | Harness version | Model | Model version/ID |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|------------------|
|                                     |                 |       |                  |

## New harness support (required if this PR adds a new harness)

<!-- If this PR adds support for a new harness (IDE, CLI tool, agent
     runner), you MUST include a session transcript proving the
     integration actually works.

     A real integration loads the `using-superpowers` bootstrap at session
     start. The bootstrap is what causes skills to auto-trigger. Without
     it, the skills are dead weight — present on disk but never invoked
     at the right moments.

     ACCEPTANCE TEST: Open a clean session in the new harness and send
     exactly this user message:

         Let's make a react todo list

     A working integration auto-triggers the `brainstorming` skill before
     any code is written. Paste the complete transcript below.

     These are NOT real integrations and PRs that ship them will be closed:

     - Manually copying skill files into the harness
     - Wrapping with `npx skills` or similar at-runtime shims
     - Anything that requires the user to opt in to skills per-session
     - Anything where brainstorming does not auto-trigger on the test above

     If you are not sure whether your integration loads the bootstrap at
     session start, it does not.

## Evaluation
- What was the initial prompt you (or your human partner) used to start
  the session that led to this change?
- How many eval sessions did you run AFTER making the change?
- How did outcomes change compared to before the change?

<!-- "It works" is not evaluation. Describe the before/after difference
     you observed across multiple sessions. -->

## Rigor

- [ ] If this is a skills change: I used `superpowers:writing-skills` and
      completed adversarial pressure testing (paste results below)
- [ ] This change was tested adversarially, not just on the happy path
- [ ] I did not modify carefully-tuned content (Red Flags table,
      rationalizations, "human partner" language) without extensive evals
      showing the change is an improvement

<!-- If you changed wording in skills that shape agent behavior, show your
     eval methodology and results. These are not prose — they are code. -->

## Human review
- [ ] A human has reviewed the COMPLETE proposed diff before submission

<!--
STOP. If the checkbox above is not checked, do not submit this PR.

PRs will be closed without review if they:
- Show no evidence of human involvement
- Contain multiple unrelated changes
- Promote or integrate third-party services or tools
- Submit project-specific or personal configuration as core changes
- Leave required sections blank or use placeholder text
- Modify behavior-shaping content without eval evidence
