# Plugin Development Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for developing Claude Code plugins with expert guidance on hooks, MCP integration, plugin structure, and marketplace publishing.

## Overview

The plugin-dev toolkit provides seven specialized skills to help you build high-quality Claude Code plugins:

1. **hook-development** - Advanced hooks API and event-driven automation
2. **mcp-integration** - Model Context Protocol server integration
3. **plugin-structure** - Plugin organization and manifest configuration
4. **plugin-settings** - Configuration patterns using .claude/plugin-name.local.md files
5. **command-development** - Creating slash commands with frontmatter and arguments
6. **agent-development** - Creating autonomous agents with AI-assisted generation
7. **skill-development** - Creating skills with progressive disclosure and strong triggers

Each skill follows best practices with progressive disclosure: lean core documentation, detailed references, working examples, and utility scripts.

## Guided Workflow Command

### /plugin-dev:create-plugin

A comprehensive, end-to-end workflow command for creating plugins from scratch, similar to the feature-dev workflow.

**8-Phase Process:**
1. **Discovery** - Understand plugin purpose and requirements
2. **Component Planning** - Determine needed skills, commands, agents, hooks, MCP
3. **Detailed Design** - Specify each component and resolve ambiguities
4. **Structure Creation** - Set up directories and manifest
5. **Component Implementation** - Create each component using AI-assisted agents
6. **Validation** - Run plugin-validator and component-specific checks
7. **Testing** - Verify plugin works in Claude Code
8. **Documentation** - Finalize README and prepare for distribution

**Features:**
- Asks clarifying questions at each phase
- Loads relevant skills automatically
- Uses agent-creator for AI-assisted agent generation
- Runs validation utilities (validate-agent.sh, validate-hook-schema.sh, etc.)
- Follows plugin-dev's own proven patterns
- Guides through testing and verification

**Usage:**
```bash
/plugin-dev:create-plugin [optional description]

# Examples:
/plugin-dev:create-plugin
/plugin-dev:create-plugin A plugin for managing database migrations
```

Use this workflow for structured, high-quality plugin development from concept to completion.

## Installation

Install from claude-code-marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install plugin-dev@claude-code-marketplace
```

Or for development, use directly:

```bash
cc --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin-dev
```

## Quick Start

### Creating Your First Plugin

1. **Plan your plugin structure:**
   - Ask: "What's the best directory structure for a plugin with commands and MCP integration?"
   - The plugin-structure skill will guide you

2. **Add MCP integration (if needed):**
   - Ask: "How do I add an MCP server for database access?"
   - The mcp-integration skill provides examples and patterns

3. **Implement hooks (if needed):**
   - Ask: "Create a PreToolUse hook that validates file writes"
   - The hook-development skill gives working examples and utilities


## Development Workflow

The plugin-dev toolkit supports your entire plugin development lifecycle:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Design Structure   │  → plugin-structure skill
│  (manifest, layout) │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼──────────┐
│  Add Components     │
│  (commands, agents, │  → All skills provide guidance
│   skills, hooks)    │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼──────────┐

           │
┌──────────▼──────────┐
│  Add Automation     │  → hook-development skill
│  (hooks, validation)│     + utility scripts
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼──────────┐
│  Test & Validate    │  → hook-development utilities
│                     │     validate-hook-schema.sh
└──────────┬──────────┘     test-hook.sh
           │                 hook-linter.sh
```

## Features

### Progressive Disclosure

Each skill uses a three-level disclosure system:
1. **Metadata** (always loaded): Concise descriptions with strong triggers
2. **Core SKILL.md** (when triggered): Essential API reference (~1,500-2,000 words)
3. **References/Examples** (as needed): Detailed guides, patterns, and working code

This keeps Claude Code's context focused while providing deep knowledge when needed.

### Utility Scripts

The hook-development skill includes production-ready utilities:

```bash
# Validate hooks.json structure
./validate-hook-schema.sh hooks/hooks.json

# Test hooks before deployment
./test-hook.sh my-hook.sh test-input.json

# Lint hook scripts for best practices
./hook-linter.sh my-hook.sh
```

### Working Examples

Every skill provides working examples:
- **hook-development**: 3 complete hook scripts (bash, write validation, context loading)
- **mcp-integration**: 3 server configurations (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- **plugin-structure**: 3 plugin layouts (minimal, standard, advanced)
- **plugin-settings**: 3 examples (read-settings hook, create-settings command, templates)
- **command-development**: 10 complete command examples (review, test, deploy, docs, etc.)

## Documentation Standards

All skills follow consistent standards:
- Third-person descriptions ("This skill should be used when...")
- Strong trigger phrases for reliable loading
- Imperative/infinitive form throughout
- Based on official Claude Code documentation
- Security-first approach with best practices

## Total Content

- **Core Skills**: ~11,065 words across 7 SKILL.md files
- **Reference Docs**: ~10,000+ words of detailed guides
- **Examples**: 12+ working examples (hook scripts, MCP configs, plugin layouts, settings files)
- **Utilities**: 6 production-ready validation/testing/parsing scripts

## Use Cases

### Building a Database Plugin

```
1. "What's the structure for a plugin with MCP integration?"
   → plugin-structure skill provides layout

2. "How do I configure an stdio MCP server for PostgreSQL?"
   → mcp-integration skill shows configuration

3. "Add a Stop hook to ensure connections close properly"
   → hook-development skill provides pattern

```

### Creating a Validation Plugin

```
1. "Create hooks that validate all file writes for security"
   → hook-development skill with examples

2. "Test my hooks before deploying"
   → Use validate-hook-schema.sh and test-hook.sh

3. "Organize my hooks and configuration files"
   → plugin-structure skill shows best practices

```

### Integrating External Services

```
1. "Add Asana MCP server with OAuth"
   → mcp-integration skill covers SSE servers

2. "Use Asana tools in my commands"

   → plugin-structure skill provides patterns
```

## Best Practices

All skills emphasize:

✅ **Security First**
- Input validation in hooks
- HTTPS/WSS for MCP servers
- Environment variables for credentials
- Principle of least privilege

✅ **Portability**
- Use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} everywhere
- Relative paths only
- Environment variable substitution

✅ **Testing**
- Validate configurations before deployment
- Test hooks with sample inputs
- Use debug mode (`claude --debug`)

✅ **Documentation**
- Clear README files
- Documented environment variables
- Usage examples
