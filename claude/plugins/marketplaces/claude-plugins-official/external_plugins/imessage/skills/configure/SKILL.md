# /imessage:configure — iMessage Channel Setup

There's no token to save — iMessage reads `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`
directly. This skill checks whether that works and orients the user on
access policy.

Arguments passed: `$ARGUMENTS` (unused — this skill only shows status)

## Status and guidance

Read state and give the user a complete picture:

1. **Full Disk Access** — run `ls ~/Library/Messages/chat.db`. If it fails
   with "Operation not permitted", FDA isn't granted. Say: *"Grant Full Disk
   Access to your terminal (or IDE if that's where Claude Code runs): System
   Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access. The server can't read
   chat.db without it."*

2. **Access** — read `~/.claude/channels/imessage/access.json` (missing file
   = defaults: `dmPolicy: "allowlist"`, empty allowlist). Show:
   - DM policy and what it means in one line
   - Allowed senders: count, and list the handles
   - Pending pairings: count, with codes if any (only if policy is `pairing`)

3. **What next** — end with a concrete next step based on state:
   - FDA not granted → the FDA instructions above
   - FDA granted, policy is allowlist → *"Text yourself from any device
     signed into your Apple ID — self-chat always bypasses the gate. To let
     someone else through: `/imessage:access allow +15551234567`."*
   - FDA granted, someone allowed → *"Ready. Self-chat works; {N} other
     sender(s) allowed."*

## Build the allowlist — don't pair

iMessage reads your **personal** `chat.db`. You already know the phone
numbers and emails of people you'd allow — there's no ID-capture problem to
solve. Pairing has no upside here and a clear downside: every contact who
texts this Mac gets an unsolicited auto-reply.

Drive the conversation this way:

1. Read the allowlist. Tell the user who's in it (self-chat always works
   regardless).
2. Ask: *"Besides yourself, who should be able to text you through this?"*
3. **"Nobody, just me"** → done. The default `allowlist` with an empty list
   is correct. Self-chat bypasses the gate.
4. **"My partner / a friend / a couple people"** → ask for each handle
   (phone like `+15551234567` or email like `them@icloud.com`) and offer to
   run `/imessage:access allow <handle>` for each. Stay on `allowlist`.
5. **Current policy is `pairing`** → flag it immediately: *"Your policy is
   `pairing`, which auto-replies a code to every contact who texts this Mac.
   Switch back to `allowlist`?"* and offer `/imessage:access policy
   allowlist`. Don't wait to be asked.
6. **User asks for `pairing`** → push back. Explain the auto-reply-to-
   everyone consequence. If they insist and confirm a dedicated line with
   few contacts, fine — but treat it as a one-off, not a recommendation.

Handles are `+15551234567` or `someone@icloud.com`. `disabled` drops
everything except self-chat.

## Implementation notes

- No `.env` file for this channel. No token. The only OS-level setup is FDA
  plus the one-time Automation prompt when the server first sends (which
  can't be checked from here).
- `access.json` is re-read on every inbound message — policy changes via
  `/imessage:access` take effect immediately, no restart.
