# OpenCode ECC Plugin

> ⚠️ This README is specific to OpenCode usage.  
> If you installed ECC via npm (e.g. `npm install opencode-ecc`), refer to the root README instead.

Everything Claude Code (ECC) plugin for OpenCode - agents, commands, hooks, and skills.

## Installation

## Installation Overview

There are two ways to use Everything Claude Code (ECC):

1. **npm package (recommended for most users)**  
   Install via npm/bun/yarn and use the `ecc-install` CLI to set up rules and agents.

2. **Direct clone / plugin mode**  
   Clone the repository and run OpenCode directly inside it.

Choose the method that matches your workflow below.

### Option 1: npm Package

```bash
npm install ecc-universal
```

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["ecc-universal"]
}
```

This loads the ECC OpenCode plugin module from npm:
- hook/event integrations
- bundled custom tools exported by the plugin

It does **not** auto-register the full ECC command/agent/instruction catalog in your project config. For the full OpenCode setup, either:
- run OpenCode inside this repository, or
- copy the relevant `.opencode/commands/`, `.opencode/prompts/`, `.opencode/instructions/`, and the `instructions`, `agent`, and `command` config entries into your own project

After installation, the `ecc-install` CLI is also available:

```bash
npx ecc-install typescript
```

### Option 2: Direct Use

Clone and run OpenCode in the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code
cd everything-claude-code
opencode
```

## Hook Event Mapping

OpenCode's plugin system maps to Claude Code hooks:

| Claude Code | OpenCode |
|-------------|----------|
| PreToolUse | `tool.execute.before` |
| PostToolUse | `tool.execute.after` |
| Stop | `session.idle` |
| SessionStart | `session.created` |
| SessionEnd | `session.deleted` |

OpenCode has 20+ additional events not available in Claude Code.

### Hook Runtime Controls

OpenCode plugin hooks honor the same runtime controls used by Claude Code/Cursor:

```bash
export ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=standard
export ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS="pre:bash:tmux-reminder,post:edit:typecheck"
```

- `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE`: `minimal`, `standard` (default), `strict`
- `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS`: comma-separated hook IDs to disable

## Skills

The default OpenCode config loads 11 curated ECC skills via the `instructions` array:

- coding-standards
- backend-patterns
- frontend-patterns
- frontend-slides
- security-review
- tdd-workflow
- strategic-compact
- eval-harness
- verification-loop
- api-design
- e2e-testing

Additional specialized skills are shipped in `skills/` but not loaded by default to keep OpenCode sessions lean:

- article-writing
- content-engine
- market-research
- investor-materials
- investor-outreach

## Configuration
